---OOP:

##Class and Static Methods( Methods that belong to the class and not the instance):

class BankAccount:
    # class attribute
    bank_name = "First National Dojo"
    all_accounts = []
    def __init__(self, int_rate,balance):
        self.int_rate = int_rate
        self.balance = balance
        BankAccount.all_accounts.append(self)
    
    # class method to change the name of the bank
    @classmethod
    def change_bank_name(cls,name):
        cls.bank_name = name
    # class method to get balance of all accounts
    @classmethod
    def all_balances(cls):
        sum = 0
        # we use cls to refer to the class
        for account in cls.all_accounts:
            sum += account.balance
        return sum
		
class BankAccount:
    # ... __init__ goes here
    def with_draw(self,amount):
        # we can use the static method here to evaluate
        # if we can with draw the funds without going negative
        if BankAccount.can_withdraw(self.balance,amount):
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient Funds")
        return self    
    # static methods have no access to any attribute
    # only to what is passed into it
    @staticmethod
    def can_withdraw(balance,amount):
    	if (balance - amount) < 0:
	    return False
        else:
	    return True

##Association Between Classes:
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.account = BankAccount(int_rate=0.02, balance=0)	# added this line
